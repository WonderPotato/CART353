//this class will be the environment to affect the floating stuff
//since this 2D world will be in space
//the force of this class will be of a gaseous state
//so it will sort of behave like a liquid
//only it won't because it's a gas
//so using the gravitational force formula
//and other stuff this class will do science physics stuff on everything
//this class will be enclosed in a specific area of the world
//specifically the left side as a rectangle with maybe some wavy borders who knows tbh
