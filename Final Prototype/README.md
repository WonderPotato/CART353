the 3D space becomes pew pew in space the experience!*

*(if you have a windows computer, a kinect for windows device, then you can experience it, otherwise a video demosntrates the installation!)

## Initial Artist Statement

the project shifted from a vague and abstract experience :

Create an Action/Reaction environment for the individual to immerse themselves in. An interaction to distract the individual from technology by surrounding them with technology. I wish to create a program that will track the body of the user, and by having certain parts identified, will allow for custom reactionary functions when interacting with floating entities in the virtual environment. The experience needs to be tranquil and engaging all at once, to be able to bring the individual a sense of comfort in a world where all things technology are distracting and accumulative chaos. By bringing the user into a world of technology, they get to step away from their own technology for just a few moments of their time. Having the environment be of darkness and minimalistic visuals in the background, brings emphasis onto the entities, making them glow and orbit in independent behaviours around the user, making the individual pass off as the sun of the solar system, being in control of themselves, while trying to interact with an unknown environment. I believe in creating a peaceful and neutral environment, which will allow the user to create their own experience with technology in an engaging and stimulating way. I am hoping this project can bring some inspiration towards augmented and virtual realities, and really explore the ways humans interact with non existent materiality in virtual surroundings. This project has the potential to delve deeper into the reactions of humans with their own interactivity with virtual and projected environments.

then the final product delve into this experience. Fun in space with no judgement......

## Final Artist Statement 2.0

Artist's Statement
This should be a roughly 400 word artist's statement that briefly explains the underlying concept of your project and why it is worthy of exploration, your implementation of these ideas in code. It should communicate some of the design or research-creation insights generated as a result of the project.
