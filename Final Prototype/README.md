# CART353

the 3D space becomes pew pew in space the experience!*

*(if you have a windows computer, a kinect for windows device, then you can experience it, otherwise a video demosntrates the installation!)

## Initial Artist Statement

the project shifted from a vague and abstract experience :

Create an Action/Reaction environment for the individual to immerse themselves in. An interaction to distract the individual from technology by surrounding them with technology. I wish to create a program that will track the body of the user, and by having certain parts identified, will allow for custom reactionary functions when interacting with floating entities in the virtual environment. The experience needs to be tranquil and engaging all at once, to be able to bring the individual a sense of comfort in a world where all things technology are distracting and accumulative chaos. By bringing the user into a world of technology, they get to step away from their own technology for just a few moments of their time. Having the environment be of darkness and minimalistic visuals in the background, brings emphasis onto the entities, making them glow and orbit in independent behaviours around the user, making the individual pass off as the sun of the solar system, being in control of themselves, while trying to interact with an unknown environment. I believe in creating a peaceful and neutral environment, which will allow the user to create their own experience with technology in an engaging and stimulating way. I am hoping this project can bring some inspiration towards augmented and virtual realities, and really explore the ways humans interact with non existent materiality in virtual surroundings. This project has the potential to delve deeper into the reactions of humans with their own interactivity with virtual and projected environments.

then the final product delve into this experience. Fun in space with no judgement......

## Final Artist Statement 2.0

Pew pew in space seems more fun than some odd abstract experience, personally some humour in creative computation can go a long way.
Initially I had this vision of a calm and deep meaningful installation that might bring out a deeper sense of awareness in one’s self. By bringing the abstract into the coding using the kinect I was able to experiment with different results. Although what I was able to accomplish with the first version didn’t reach the mark and when turning to the Kinect v2 I got more out of the device and got some interesting results.   This allowed for a deeper dive into the concept and what I wanted to explore with creative computing. To have fun with technology and to try and not take ourselves seriously for once. 

I wanted to bring the fantasy world that we immerse ourselves in with movies and games and to bring it to the Kinect platform to have a virtual grasp on that world.  my design and code relate to the colourful and nostalgic sci fi genres of Star Wars and space exploration. Our solar system is just the start of the curiosity in our galaxy and universe. So why not bring some fun with the curiosity. I brought in the force attracted objects around their suns and placed those on the users skeleton display’s shoulder.  The code used displays these suns and their planets while having their orbit move around the person. Surrounding them with color and movement. I also added many imagery of Star Wars whenever the user moves or should I say swings their lightsaber wielding hands downwards in a force stricken slash. By doing so gifs appear depending which side they choose. For other visual reactions I placed imagery that is activated by the users arm position.   

The art of interacting with technology for one’s entertainment can be varied, and with creative computing one can create possibilities that can allow for an enjoyable and colourful experience. This project was able to bring a nostalgic and fantasy driven world into a virtual experience for the user to engage with freely and without judgement. 
So really I created a calm environment for someone to have fun in and relieve some sci-fi moments. 

I feel this project reached a certain goal in my vision for this creative computation. I learned the difficulties of working with a hardware that it’s designers have stopped innovating on for the general public and that previous version of processing had some better luck.  For a graphics based programming language, processing has only a limited amount of possibility with the Kinect. For what I learned to make with the Kinect I was able to create an exciting and fun experience for which I enjoyed creating and had a good many laughs interacting with the final prototype. I hope others will too.

start the file and press play!



## Resources

the lack of documentation for the main library for this project was severely lacking, this required lots of time researching various projects and websites using similar libraries and creating their own examples and documentation.

thankfully there is always help.

Kodrin from class was very helpful his code got to work super well for the skeleton display so that helped me clean up my code and multiple tabs of drawing within the main code file. 

I used code from the fireworks pde  from the coding train.
